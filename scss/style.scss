// Base: holds the boilerplate code for the project. Including standard styles such as resets and typographic rules, which are commonly used throughout your project.
@import "partials/base/base";


// Pages: any styles specific to individual pages will sit here. For example it’s not uncommon for the home page of your site to require page specific styles that no other page receives.
@import "partials/pages/centroPoke";
@import "partials/pages/fotoTienda";
@import "partials/pages/index";

// Layout: contains all styles involved with the layout of your project. Such as styles for your header, footer, navigation and the grid system.
@import "partials/layout/footer";
@import "partials/layout/header";
@import "partials/layout/nav";

// Components (or modules): holds all of your styles for buttons, carousels, sliders, and similar page components (think widgets). Your project will typically contain a lot of component files — as the whole site/app should be mostly composed of small modules.
@import "partials/components/buttons";


// Abstracts (or utilities): holds Sass tools, helper files, variables, functions, mixins and other config files. These files are meant to be just helpers which don’t output any CSS when compiled.
@import "partials/abstracts/extend";
@import "partials/abstracts/mixins";
@import "partials/abstracts/variables";
